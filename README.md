# Explorations in Data Science
### Columbia University [Science Honors Program](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/shp/)
### Spring 2016

#### About this course
In this course, students (aka, the explorers)  will carry out a series of exploration in data science to learn about statistical thinking principles and data analysis skills used in data science. 

These explorations will cover topics include but not limited to 
- descriptive statistics, 
- sampling and estimation, 
- association, 
- regression analysis, etc. 

The classes will be organized to have a lecture component and a hands-on exploration component each session. In the lecture session, an introductory curriculum on data science will be given. In the exploration session, students will be led through data analysis exercises using the statistical analysis language [R](https://cran.r-project.org/). These exercises are designed to use open data such as [NYC open data](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/) that contain interesting information about neighborhoods of New York City. No prior programming experience is required.
